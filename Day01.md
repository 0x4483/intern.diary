__Description__


I have set up dev-box and ssh key with LDAP today. Downloaded text editors and data analytic tools like R-Studio. Wrapping up on the legal documentations and talked to Sashi today about verifying the number of features from the spam data. Tomorrow, I will watch some video Travis gave and worked on building a good dataframe from that 3.7 GB of spam data. Ideally, I can also get to building several models and testify the misclassifications rate. As a scratch, I want to document well how each model is doing the job and create a visual presentation for the models as well as documented justifications for code design.
