__Day Review__

I have set up dev-box and ssh key with LDAP today. Downloaded text editors and data analytic tools like R-Studio. Wrapping up on the legal documentations and talked to Sashi today about verifying the number of features from the spam data. Tomorrow, I will watch the speech Travis gave and worked on building a good dataframe from the 3.7 GB spam data. Ideally, I can also get to build several models and testify the misclassification rates. In addition, I want to document well how each model is doing the job and create a visual presentation for the models as well as documented justifications for code design. In the afternoon, the group went for a cocktail party with appertizer as a network event. We also stopped by a 3D model shop to get our photograph taken.
