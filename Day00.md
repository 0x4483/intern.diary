__Day Review__

The orientation starts at 10 am in the morning and there are five other interns besides me. I am the only one in the content
intelligence team. Four of the five are in the engineering department. We set up internet, Tumblr Confluence administration, VPN 
Yahoo Backyard. The finance, legal, product and security department came and gave us presentations about what 
each department is doing in the company to give a bird-view of Tumblr. Presentation ends around 4 PM, and I talked with 
Sashi about my ideas on spamming and possibly implementing some NPL algorithm on content analysis. It is important to set up the 
VM tomorrow morning and start learning about Jupiter, Hadoop Hive, Scalding and Spark soon. In addition, I should start building 
the prototype Sashi was talking about using experience at Capital One with fraud detection. Rapid prototyping is key to success 
and the first step is to understand all the platform and get used to the enviroments between them.
